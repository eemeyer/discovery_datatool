This directory contains a standard init script wrapper for the data tool.

To install:

1) Copy init.d/discovery_datatool to /etc/init.d/discovery_datatool.
2) Copy sysconfig/discovery_datatool file to /etc/sysconfig/discovery_datatool.
3) Edit /etc/sysconfig/discovery_datatool and set the RELEASE_DIR variable.

The default settings require a datatool user. The default run directory
the is /opt/discovery/engines/feed.

Archived release zip files should be stored in /opt/discovery/archives
and the unzipped releases should be in /opt/discovery/releases.

Once configured you can start/stop the data tool by running
/etc/init.d/discovery_datatool.

If you require multiple data tool installs on a single box just copy the
discovery_datatool scripts in /etc/init.d and /etc/sysconfig and give each install
a different name.

If you wish to start multiple discovery data tool instances automatically on
startup you will need to make multiple copies of the /etc/init.d/discovery_datatool
script and tie it to a configuration file in /etc/sysconfig/discovery_datatool via
setting of the CONF_FILE variable in the script.

It is recommended that you use a suffix that helps identify which data tool is
starting and synchronize the init.d script name with the configuration file
name. For example, /etc/init.d/discovery_datatool-testing would have the CONF_FILE
variable set to /etc/sysconfig/discovery_datatool-testing which would be created from
/etc/sysconfig/discovery_datatool and set the correct DATATOOL_DIR to use.

DEBIAN
------

Debian users should follow the previous instructions but replace all
references to /etc/sysconfig with /etc/default.
