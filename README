The Discovery Data Tool provides a cross-platform implementation of a Changeset
Publisher. It uses JDBC to connect to the database and is thus compatible
with most major databases.

Documentation can be found at:

  https://transparensee.com/docs

To build the release run:

  ant clean release

To use the release, get the built zip from

  build.ant/discovery_datatool.zip

Unpack it and create a discovery_datatool.xml configuration file. The release
includes example configuration files in the examples directory of the zip file.

Then run the tool by executing the run.sh script.

Release Notes
-------------

1.5 - 2011-08-04

  * Adds support for "vertical" tables.

1.4 - 2011-03-08

  * Creates new version of Data Tool Configuration XML schema to support bulk
    and full changesets and subqueries.
  * Adds support for bulk and full changesets in addition to snapshots.
  * Adds support for a wide variety of subquery types in order to better
    support flattening complex database structures without the use of views or
    stored procedures.
  * Fixes WebServerMain to handle paths with spaces in directory names. Fixes
    problem where datatool cannot be run if its path contains spaces.
  * Updates tests to verify tool continutes to be backwards compatible in
    parsing all versions of the configuration xml.
  * Adds support for column aliases.
  * Makes named SQL parameter matching case insensitive by creating and using
    CaseInsensitveParameterSource (based on Spring's MapSqlParameterSource,
    which unfortunately does not allow plugging in a different Map
    implementation). All tests now pass.
  * Updates logging.properties to log com.t11e.discovery.datatool at FINE. And
    adds a comment explaining how to enable logging sql query execution speed.
    Turns down default level to WARNING (which quiets Spring).
  * Adds test to show that Discovery Data Tool can call stored procedures.

1.3 - 2010-10-01

  * Adds forceSnapshot boolean parameter to ChangesetController. If true, then
    start date of null is used and a snapshot is created regardless of the
    profile's last run time.

1.2 - 2010-09-07

  * Adds support for protecting incoming connections via SSL and basic
    authentication.
  * Adds throwing an exception in config XML does not have a root config
    element in a recognized namespace.

1.1 - 2010-06-11

  * Added createSql support to sqlProfile, used to auto create missing
    changeset profiles.
  * Bumped the schema from http://transparensee.com/schema/datatool-config-1
    to http://transparensee.com/schema/datatool-config-2.
  * Added init script to the built release, depends upon Apache Commons Daemon
    jsvc (http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html).
  * Fixed Configuration parsing issue where long text elements in the XML
    were being truncated.

1.0 - 2010-06-03
